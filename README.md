. Identifying Key Motifs in DNA Sequences
Genomic sequences contain regulatory and structural elements crucial for gene expression. The script identifies:
•	Start codons (ATG): Initiates translation.
•	Stop codons (TAA, TAG, TGA): Terminates translation.
•	TATA Box (TATAAA): A promoter region for transcription initiation.
•	CAAT Box & GC Box: Regulatory elements for transcription.
•	Splice sites (GT-AG rule): Defines exon-intron boundaries.
•	Polyadenylation signal (AATAAA): Signals for mRNA stability.
Why? These motifs are essential for understanding gene structure, regulation, and functionality.

Translation and Protein Weight Calculation
2. Translating DNA to Protein
The script converts a DNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence using the standard genetic code. This is achieved by reading codons (triplets of nucleotides) and mapping them to amino acids. The translation process stops at the first encountered stop codon.
3. Protein Molecular Weight Calculation
After translation, the molecular weight of the protein is computed using the standard amino acid molecular weights. This is crucial for downstream applications like SDS-PAGE, where protein size influences migration.
Why? Protein expression studies often rely on expected molecular weights to verify successful gene expression.

4. Selection of Restriction Sites
To clone the gene into an expression vector, restriction enzyme sites must be added to the primers. The script uses:
•	NdeI (CATATG) at the 5’ end: This site contains the ATG start codon, ensuring correct initiation.
•	XhoI (CTCGAG) at the 3’ end: Allows directional cloning, maintaining proper reading frame alignment.
5. Forward and Reverse Primer Design
The script generates two primers:
•	Forward primer: NdeI site + first 20 bases of the gene
•	Reverse primer: XhoI site + reverse complement of last 20 bases
Why? These primers ensure efficient cloning while preserving reading frame and His-tag functionality.

Experimental Design for Gene Expression and Protein Purification
6. Examining Gene Expression via RT-qPCR
Quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) is used to measure gene expression levels. The experiment involves:
1.	RNA Extraction: Isolating total RNA from cells.
2.	cDNA Synthesis: Using reverse transcriptase to generate cDNA.
3.	qPCR Setup: Using SYBR Green or TaqMan probes for amplification.
4.	Normalization: Comparing target gene expression to a housekeeping gene.
5.	Analysis: Ct values indicate relative expression levels.
7. Expressing and Purifying Recombinant Protein
To express and analyze Gene X:
1.	Cloning into pET28a: Using primers designed earlier.
2.	Transformation into E. coli BL21(DE3): A strain optimized for protein expression.
3.	Induction with IPTG: Stimulating gene expression.
4.	Protein Purification: Using Ni-NTA chromatography to isolate His-tagged protein.
5.	Validation by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot:
o	SDS-PAGE confirms molecular weight.
o	Western Blot ensures specificity using anti-His antibodies.
